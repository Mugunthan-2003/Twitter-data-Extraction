Client.get_users_tweets(id, *, end_time=None, exclude=None, expansions=None, max_results=None, media_fields=None, pagination_token=None, place_fields=None, poll_fields=None, since_id=None, start_time=None, tweet_fields=None, until_id=None, user_fields=None, user_auth=False)
Returns Tweets composed by a single user, specified by the requested user ID. By default, the most recent ten Tweets are returned per request. Using pagination, the most recent 3,200 Tweets can be retrieved.

The Tweets returned by this endpoint count towards the Project-level Tweet cap.

Parameters
id (int | str) – Unique identifier of the Twitter account (user ID) for whom to return results. User ID can be referenced using the user/lookup endpoint. More information on Twitter IDs is here.

end_time (datetime.datetime | str | None) –

YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ (ISO 8601/RFC 3339). The newest or most recent UTC timestamp from which the Tweets will be provided. Only the 3200 most recent Tweets are available. Timestamp is in second granularity and is inclusive (for example, 12:00:01 includes the first second of the minute). Minimum allowable time is 2010-11-06T00:00:01Z

Please note that this parameter does not support a millisecond value.

exclude (list[str] | str | None) – Comma-separated list of the types of Tweets to exclude from the response. When exclude=retweets is used, the maximum historical Tweets returned is still 3200. When the exclude=replies parameter is used for any value, only the most recent 800 Tweets are available.

expansions (list[str] | str | None) – expansions Parameter

max_results (int | None) – Specifies the number of Tweets to try and retrieve, up to a maximum of 100 per distinct request. By default, 10 results are returned if this parameter is not supplied. The minimum permitted value is 5. It is possible to receive less than the max_results per request throughout the pagination process.

media_fields (list[str] | str | None) – media_fields

pagination_token (str | None) – This parameter is used to move forwards or backwards through ‘pages’ of results, based on the value of the next_token or previous_token in the response.

since_id (int | str | None) – Returns results with a Tweet ID greater than (that is, more recent than) the specified ‘since’ Tweet ID. Only the 3200 most recent Tweets are available. The result will exclude the since_id. If the limit of Tweets has occurred since the since_id, the since_id will be forced to the oldest ID available.

start_time (datetime.datetime | str | None) –

YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ (ISO 8601/RFC 3339). The oldest or earliest UTC timestamp from which the Tweets will be provided. Only the 3200 most recent Tweets are available.
